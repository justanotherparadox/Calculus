My attempt to find a closed form for a derivative of a product of 'n' functions that are all differentiable.

Then, there is the Leibnitz Theorem which was easy.

Finally my attempt to find a closed expression for Nth derivative of a product of 'n' functions (all differentiable N-fold). I failed 
miserably on my first attempt as I was unable to find or see the hidden combinatorial pattern. Furthermore, I was not considering a full 
generalization and hence taking (N=n) in place of which I should have taken (N=m).

I succeeded in my second attempt to do so. And, the closed form is somewhat complicated but remarkably beautiful and elegant.Oh man! That 
was tough.


There are a few books which I would recommend for interested students.

I will be giving an order in which a newbie can read and understand the material without breaking the learning curve.
Additional changes will be made from time to time.
