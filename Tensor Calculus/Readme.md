4. You can then read the two books I have uploaded. You must be familiar with Linear Algebra in order to understand them. The main reason for putting them at this place is due to their sophistication.

5. [Introduction to Differential Geometry of Space Curves and Surfaces](https://www.amazon.in/dp/1546735895/?coliid=IOW39QW7897C&colid=22Q8X0SEDYMS3&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) by Taha Sochi ------> If your project requires you to be aware of Differential Geometry, to say.
